# Hangman-Project
This is my python coded version of the Hangman game 

## milestone-2.py file
- I created a variable named word_list that contained five fruit names in a list
- I created a word variable and using the random module (specifically random.choice function) to randomly generate a word from the word_list and assign it to the word variable 
- I made a input called guess which asks the user for a letter 
- I then made if and else statements to make sure the input was one letter and that the input was in the alphabet
